## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- pip

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/gztarchiver-ui-backend.git`
3. Create a python environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
4. Activate the python environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`


## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation changes


Create a topic branch from the main branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Messages

Write clear and meaningful commit messages. We recommend following this format:

```
[TYPE] Short description (max 50 chars)

Longer description if needed. Explain the "why" behind the change,
not just the "what". Reference any related issues.

Fixes #123
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Run `black` for formatting
- Run `flake8` for linting


### Testing

- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass: `pytest`
- Maintain or improve code coverage

All changes should include appropriate tests. Run the test suite before submitting:

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

1. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards
2. Update documentation if needed
